*** PART III (10 pt) ***

Is it a good idea to start the game with the Reed opening?

  To be honest, I don't think this is a easy question which can be answered systematically
without sufficiently enough data about games and game results.
  The advantage of reed opening is that it can block the central part of the board and
also make it easier for Reed itself to not be blocked when it crosses the central 'hole'.
  The reed opening seems to keep the opponent from going through the central part of the board and
opens the space for itself to go forward easier, but the premise is that it needs to arrive at the central point
between the 2 walls, or at least the row where the walls are,sooner than the opponent. From this view, I think
the opponent can place walls to prevent the Reed players from achieving the central place quickly.
  For example I tried to place walls in the lowest 2 rows in front of Reed to make the distance for it
to reach the center longer than normal, which makes it possible for me to reach the central hole first.
In this situation, the walls it places at the start of the game might become obstacles for itself
to get out of the lower part of this board.
  However, I also tried to let 2 minimax players which shared the same minimax algorithms
setting but one of them using Reed opening to play with each other. The opponent of Reed player chose a similar
strategy as mine to place walls to prevent the Reed player from arriving at the central point. And the normal
player tended to win more.
  From the observation on the agent I designed, it seems Reed opening doesn't perform quite well. But it is not
that easy to determine whether this opening is good or not generally without sufficiently game playing data to
analyse only with the basic minimax AI.
